    <h1> I am a nerd. Or a geek. Whatever are the names, I'm just a guy passionate about IT.  </h1>
    <p> I started my computer journey somewhere about 13-14 years ago. In the beginning it was all about Linux and webmastering. I installed Fedora Core 3 all by myself at the age of 9. Not long after I began learning HTML. Then CSS, PHP and the story goes. I always had this little thing for security. I learned few attacks and major bug types in web applications in later Primary School.  </p>
    <p> I believe in open source and doing things driven by love for the code and technology. I learned Ruby on Rails pretty well during last years of commercial work. Ruby is my favourite language and I feel really good in this environment. I want to find a job as a Full Stack Web Developer. I also learned Elixir and fell in love with it. I love how it mixes simplicity of Ruby and beauty of functional paradigm. Recently I learned React/Redux/ES6 stack and currently I'm diving into Vue.js/Vuex. I am very ambitious. These things are my passion and I do it regardless of job, payroll, mood or anything. I want to get involved into something, code with people from who I could learn best practises and create something significantly great and awesome together.</p>
    <p> I speak fluent English, 25 years old, stationed in Warsaw. I've been coding in Rails since mid 2014, earlier in PHP and JavaScript since forever, having 3 years of documented full-time contracts and jobs (I'll send my CV on request). Enroll me into a project and I'll do my best to rise it to the tops.</p>

    <h1>I want to work with you!</h1>
    <p> First of all, take a look at my <a href="/skillset">skillset</a> and decide if I've aquired skills that I can use to help your company grow. If i have, don't hesitate to contact me and describe what skills do you need from me. There is a big probability that even when I don't have a knowledge of a language/framework/technology you need, I will not have a single problem with learning it before starting working for/with you. This is IT after all, it's all about learning and the power of the mind. :)</p>
    <p> I will be more than happy to hear from you, so don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
